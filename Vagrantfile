  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.

  # using a specific IP.

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

    # Don't boot with headless mode

    #vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--name", "LAMP (jessie64)"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--ostype", "Debian_64"]
